# Nomad — Written Proposal

## The Problem

Van lifers and nomadic travelers form a growing community of people who live and work on the road. Yet they lack a **single, trusted place** to belong online. Existing options are fragmented: generic social apps feel noisy and impersonal; location-based apps often prioritize dating or exact tracking, which many nomads find intrusive; and specialized forums are scattered and hard to discover. As a result, it’s difficult to:

- **Find and connect** with others who share this lifestyle in an intentional way  
- **Get practical help** (electrical, solar, carpentry, mechanical) when something breaks in the middle of nowhere  
- **Discover what’s happening nearby** without sharing precise location or feeding engagement algorithms  

The gap is a **community-first digital home** for people on the road: a place where connection, mutual support, and discovery come before swipes, follower counts, or exact GPS tracking.

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Van lifers and full-time nomadic travelers (solo, couples, or small crews) who already identify with the lifestyle and want a calmer, more intentional way to connect with others like them.

**Secondary:** People seriously considering or transitioning into van life who want to learn from and connect with the community before or during their first trips.

**Characteristics:**  
- Value trust and real connections over viral content or gamified engagement  
- Often need hands-on help with builds, repairs, and systems (solar, electrical, mechanical)  
- Care about privacy and approximate location (region-level) rather than constant tracking  
- Open to optional, low-pressure dating within the community but don’t want it to dominate the product  

The app is designed to feel like *“where van lifers hang out”* — not a dating app, not a generic social feed, but a dedicated space for this audience.

## Monetization Strategy

Nomad uses a **freemium subscription model** with a clear value exchange.

**Free tier**  
- Full access to the **Community** feed: chronological posts, appreciations, comments  
- **Map** with friends and approximate locations (opt-in, region-level, time-bound)  
- **Profile** and connection system (connect with others, build trust)  
- Optional **Dating** (opt-in, secondary to community)

**Pro subscription (paid)**  
- **Helpers**: Post and respond to helper requests (e.g. “Need solar help in Arizona,” “Can do carpentry in Oregon”). This is the main paid feature — practical, high-value, and aligned with real-world needs on the road.  
- Subscriptions are managed via **RevenueCat** (iOS/Android), with standard monthly and annual options and restore purchases support.

**Why this works**  
- Free users get real value (community, map, connections), so the product grows and stays active.  
- Pro is tied to a concrete outcome (getting or giving help), not engagement metrics, which supports retention and word-of-mouth.  
- Revenue is predictable and scalable as the user base grows, with room later for additional Pro benefits (e.g. expanded map features, premium discovery) without changing the community-first positioning.
